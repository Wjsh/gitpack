About the android L Developers Preview
It might be the latest version of android as I know
As what I have learnt a little
It has an ever-smooth UI than before
And it was called a big breakthrough

Once I was thinking
Why android so slow
Once I was complaining
Something wrong had gone through

latest updated

But now everything has changed
Of what I have ever hoped
